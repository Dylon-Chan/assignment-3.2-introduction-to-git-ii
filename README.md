## What is GitHub Authentication and how/what methods available to be implemented?
GitHub Authentication refers to the process used to verify the identity of a user, application, or a process that is interacting with GitHub's services. The goal is to ensure that only authorized entities have permissions and access to certain resources or capabilities within GitHub.

There are several methods of GitHub Authentication:

1.	Basic Authentication
    - This was the simplest method of authentication where a username and password are required to authenticate.
    - GitHub recommend to use a password manager to generate a randome and unique password.
    - Two-factor authentication (2FA) is recommended where upon login, user need to provide a code which is generated by a time-based one time password (TOTP) application on the mobile device or sent as a text message (SMS).
2.	Personal Access Tokens (PATs)
    - These are tokens that users generate to authenticate their accounts when interacting with GitHub APIs. 
    - PATs are useful for scripting and automating tasks within GitHub. 
    - They can be granted a range of permissions depending on what tasks the token is intended to perform.
3.	OAuth Tokens
    - GitHub's OAuth implementation supports web, mobile, and desktop apps.
    - This authentication method allows third-party applications to access and perform actions on a GitHub account without needing user GitHub password. 
    - During the OAuth flow, the user is presented with a list of the permissions the app is requesting, and they have the option to grant or deny these permissions.
4.	GitHub Apps
    - These are a type of OAuth App that are more tightly integrated and can have more granular permissions than traditional OAuth Apps. 
    - They can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts and granted access to specific repositories.
    - They use a different kind of token, called an installation access token, to interact with GitHub APIs.
5.	SSH Keys
    - SSH keys are a way to authenticate Git commands pushed to GitHub from user local machine. 
    - User can generate a pair of keys on a local machien, a private key that keep secret on user machine and a public key is added to the user GitHub account. 
    - When the user sends a Git command, GitHub uses the public key to encrypt a message that can only be decrypted with the paired private key on user local machine.
    - This method allows secure communication without having to enter a username and password each time.
6.	SAML Single Sign-On (SSO)
    - Organizations that subscribe to GitHub Enterprise Cloud can enable SAML SSO. 
    - This allows members to authenticate to GitHub using the same credentials they use for other services in their organization.
